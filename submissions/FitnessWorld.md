Fitness World

## Project Description    
_What have you built during the hackathon?_

Fitness World is a comprehensive fitness-tracking app that helps users monitor their fitness journey by tracking workouts, setting personal fitness goals, and receiving exercise suggestions. The app is designed with a user-friendly interface, allowing users to log details like weight, workouts, duration, and calories burned. It also provides personalized workout suggestions and progress charts to help users stay on top of their fitness goals.


## Inspiration behind the Project  
_What is the story behind this project? Why did you choose to work on this specific idea?_

The inspiration behind Fitness World came from my passion for fitness and technology. I noticed a gap in the market for a fitness app that integrates workout suggestions while being intuitive and highly customizable for users. With people increasingly focusing on their health, I wanted to create a solution that tracks progress and guides users with personalized recommendations.


## Tech Stack    
_How have you built this project? Mention the technologies/methods/platforms you used to build your project._

Fitness World was built using the following technologies:
- **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Appwrite (Databases, Authentication,)
- **API**: App Ninja API for exercise suggestions
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form
- **Routing**: React Router
- **Deployment**: Vercel

### Usage of Appwrite
_Highlight any Appwrite products used within the project._

  - **Appwrite Databases**: 
  I used Appwrite Databases to store essential user profile information such as name, age, weight, height, and personalized fitness goals. The database also tracks the users' workout history, including the type of workout, duration, calories burned, and the date and time of each session. This data is critical for showing users their progress over time, which is displayed through visual charts in the app. The structure of the database allows for scalability, so as more users interact with the app, it efficiently handles and stores their fitness data.
- **Appwrite Authentication**: 
  I integrated Appwrite's authentication service to provide users with a secure and seamless login experience. Specifically, I used Google OAuth for authentication, enabling users to log in with their Google accounts. This eliminates the need for manual account creation and password management, making the process faster and more convenient. Appwriteâ€™s session management ensures that users stay logged in across different sessions, while also allowing for easy logout and account management features.
